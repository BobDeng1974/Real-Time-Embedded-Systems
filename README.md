"# Real-Time-Embedded-Systems" 

Implemented a robot control system for factory floor robots with an ARM Cortex M3 processor running Real Time Operating System(RTOS) - Î¼C/OS-III for real time collision avoidance and path planning. The robot communication was implemented by robust custom written serial device drivers. Implementation of multi-threading with over more than 16 threads was achieved using the uC-OS III and efficient memory buffer pool management.
